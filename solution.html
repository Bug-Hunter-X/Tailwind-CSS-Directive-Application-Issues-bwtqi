The solution involves understanding and resolving specificity conflicts and ensuring the correct usage of Tailwind CSS classes.  First, we should inspect the CSS structure and identify where the unintended style overrides are taking place. Tools like the browser's developer console can be invaluable here.  Next, we may need to adjust class order or use `!important` (though sparingly) to ensure the correct styles are applied.  Alternatively, we might need to restructure the HTML to improve clarity and avoid class conflicts. In the case of pseudo-class selectors, verifying the correct usage and syntax is critical. The example below shows how restructuring or using more specific selectors can solve the problem.
